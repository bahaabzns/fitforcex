Format:
```

```

## 2026-05-25 — All recent commits
**Type:** Knowledge
**What:** Last 5 commits use non-standard messages ("payments, landing", "payment", "fix stuff"-style) that violate the commit format rule in CLAUDE.md.
**Why it matters:** History becomes unreadable. Can't grep for `feat:` / `fix:` to understand what changed and when.
**Effort:** Small (adopt format going forward — no retroactive rewrite needed)
**Priority:** High

---

## 2026-05-25 — Project root (all doc files)
**Type:** Documentation
**What:** PROJECT.md, DEBT.md, DEPENDENCIES.md, GLOSSARY.md, WHY.md, LEARNING.md, REVIEWS.md were never created at project start.
**Why it matters:** No record of decisions, dependencies, or learning. Debt accumulates invisibly.
**Effort:** Small (addressed this session — files created 2026-05-25)
**Priority:** High
✅ RESOLVED 2026-05-25 — All documentation files created in session opening debt fix.

## 2026-05-25 — client/app/components/LandingPricing.js (lines 131–134)
**Type:** Shortcut
**What:** Commented-out `<h3>` and `<p>` header block left inside the `isInline` branch — dead code, never rendered.
**Why it matters:** Violates "no commented-out code" rule. Adds noise and confusion for future readers.
**Effort:** Small (delete 4 lines)
**Priority:** Medium
✅ RESOLVED 2026-05-25 — Removed commented-out block.

## 2026-05-25 — client/app/(coach)/[workspaceSlug]/settings/billing/page.js (line 43)
**Type:** Shortcut
**What:** `loadBilling` is a plain function defined inside the component body, referenced in two `useEffect` hooks. This creates a stale closure risk — if state or props it depends on change, the effects won't re-run with fresh values.
**Why it matters:** Could cause silent data staleness bugs if `loadBilling` ever needs to read component state or props.
**Effort:** Small (wrap in `useCallback` with correct deps array)
**Priority:** Medium

## 2026-05-25 — client/app/(coach)/[workspaceSlug]/settings/billing/page.js (lines 113–114)
**Type:** Knowledge
**What:** `isFreePlan` expression uses mixed `&&` / `||` without parentheses, making operator precedence non-obvious. The last `|| subscription?.planDisplay?.toLowerCase() === 'free'` evaluates independently of the first condition.
**Why it matters:** Logic is harder to reason about and could produce unexpected `true` values. Not currently a bug but fragile.
**Effort:** Small (add explicit parentheses or rewrite as a single clear condition)
**Priority:** Low

## 2026-05-25 — client/app/components/Sidebar.js (line 77)
**Type:** Shortcut
**What:** `handleLogout` uses `console.log(err)` on error instead of `console.error(err)`.
**Why it matters:** Minor — errors won't appear in browser error filters, and sensitive stack traces could be logged at wrong severity.
**Effort:** Small (one-character fix)
**Priority:** Low
✅ RESOLVED 2026-05-25 — Changed to `console.error`.

## 2026-05-25 — Project structure
**Type:** Knowledge
**What:** No `dev` branch exists — all active development is committed directly to `main`.
**Why it matters:** `main` should be production-only per CLAUDE.md branch strategy. Direct commits to main skip the safety buffer of a dev branch.
**Effort:** Small (create `dev` branch, establish branch workflow going forward)
**Priority:** High
